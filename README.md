-  Hi, I’m @lcillus
-  I'm a **spatial and graphic designer** who loves to _solve puzzles_. ^(°▽°)^
-  ╰(°▽°)╯ Here I am, _exploring_ my place at the intersection of digital/virtual/analog.
-  I don't really want to *collaborate* <(°▽°)>, but I do like **connection** .
-  You _might not get a reply_ from lcillus@outlook.com, (just being honest (°▽°)) but you can try.
